\title{The main randomization test function.}
\usage{
clique_test(Y, Z, Z_a, Z_b, Zobs_id, minr, minc, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The observed outcome vector.}

\item{Z}{A binary matrix of dimension (number of units x number of randomizations, i.e. assignments.) storing the assignment vectors.}

\item{Z_a}{A binary matrix with dimension (number of units x number of randomizations, i.e. assignments.)  Row i, column j of the matrix corresponds to whether a unit i is exposed to \code{a} under assignment j.  Please see example.}

\item{Z_b}{A binary matrix with (number of units x number of randomizations, i.e. assignments.)  Row i, column j of the matrix corresponds to whether a unit i is exposed to \code{b} under assignment j.  Please see example.}

\item{Zobs_id}{The index location of the observed assignment vector in \code{Z}, \code{Z_a}, and \code{Z_b}.}

\item{minr}{The minimum number of focal units included in the cliques (algorithm runtime is sensitive to this value).}

\item{minc}{The minimum number of focal assignment included in the cliques (algorithm runtime is sensitive to this value).}

\item{...}{Other stuff ...}
}
\value{
A list of items summarizing the randomization test.

\examples{
# generated network - 3 clusters of 2D Gaussians
# loads in the 500x500 matrix Dmat (see create_network function ...)
# Dmat just encodes all pairwise Euclidean distances between network nodes, and
# this is used to define the spillover hypothesis below.
set.seed(1)
thenetwork = out_example_network(500)
D = thenetwork$D

# simulation parameters
num_randomizations = 5000
radius = 0.01

# First, construct \code{Z}, \code{Z_a}, \code{Z_b}.
# Here, exposure \code{a} is an untreated within \code{radius} of a treated unit, and exposure \code{b} is an untreated unit at least \code{radius} distance away from all treated units.
# Experimental design is Bernoulli with prob=0.2.
# \code{a_threshold} A scalar denoting the threshold that triggers an exposure to \code{a}.  If exposure \code{a} is simply binary, i.e. whether or not unit j is exposed to \code{a}, then this value should be set to 1.
# \code{b_threshold} A scalar denoting the threshold that triggers an exposure to \code{b}.  If exposure \code{b} is simply binary, i.e. whether or not unit j is exposed to \code{b}, then this value should be set to 1.
Z = out_Z(pi=rep(0.2,dim(D)[1]),num_randomizations)
D_a = sparsify((D<radius)); a_threshold = 1
D_b = sparsify((D<radius)); b_threshold = 1

Z_a = D_a\%*\%Z
Z_a = sparsify((Z_a>=a_threshold))
Z_b = D_b\%*\%Z
Z_b = sparsify((Z_b<b_threshold))

simulating an outcome vector
Y_a = rnorm(dim(Z)[1])
Y_b = Y_a + 0.2
Y = out_Yobs(Z_a[,1],Z_b[,1],Y_a,Y_b)

run the test
CRT = clique_test(Y,Z,Z_a,Z_b,Zobs_id=1,minr=15,minc=15)
