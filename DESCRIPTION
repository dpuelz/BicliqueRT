Title: Randomization-based Testing and Inference under Interference
Version: 1.0
Author: David Puelz
Maintainer: David Puelz <David.Puelz@chicagobooth.edu>
Description: Testing of causal effects using clique-based randomization tests.  The tests condition on a clique of the null-exposure graph, allowing for complex and general interference patterns between units to be accounted for.  See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10862.pdf.
