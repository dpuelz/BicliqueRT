# CliqueRT
Randomization tests of causal effects under general interference.  The full package is under construction but will be coming soon!  It is an implentation of the clique-based randomization test developed in the paper [A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Randomization Tests of Causal Effects Under General Interference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10862.pdf).
