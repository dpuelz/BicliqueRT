# CliqueRT
R package for randomization tests of causal effects under general interference.  The full package is under construction, but the main functions are up and running!  

This is an implentation of the clique-based randomization test developed in the paper [A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Randomization Tests of Causal Effects Under General Interference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10862.pdf). If used, please cite the paper.

To use, first install devtools:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
and then, install the package:
```
library(devtools)
install.packages("dpuelz/CliqueRT")
```
